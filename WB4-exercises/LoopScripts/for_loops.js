//For loop must have:
//1. code that executes before the loop begins
//2. a condition that must be true for the loop to keep executing
//3. code that runs at the bottom of each iteration

// let count = 1; //specified that we want this to count, starting at 1

// while (count <= 7) { //Specified that we want this to count to 7]
//   console.log("hi " + count);//what word/quote we want repeated and what repeated number that is
//   count = count + 1; // or you could do count++
// }

//for loop
//1.--------;2.----------;3.------

//use chat gpt or like tools to come up with can you give me some "for loop" exercises in javascript that are for beginners with -don't give me the answer unless asked, -make it more complex
